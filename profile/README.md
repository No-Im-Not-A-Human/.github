## 🧠 Overview  

**No, I’m Not a Human** is a psychological horror game focused on paranoia, identity, and moral uncertainty. Set in a tense, enclosed environment, the experience challenges players to question appearances, intentions, and their own judgment as events unfold.

Gameplay revolves around observation and decision-making rather than action. Conversations, subtle visual cues, and environmental details shape the narrative, forcing players to determine who can be trusted and what is truly real. Each choice carries weight, influencing both story progression and emotional tension.

The minimalist presentation enhances immersion, using atmosphere, sound design, and pacing to build unease. Rather than relying on constant threats, the game creates discomfort through ambiguity and slow-burn psychological pressure.

No, I’m Not a Human delivers a compact yet intense horror experience where doubt itself becomes the main antagonist.
